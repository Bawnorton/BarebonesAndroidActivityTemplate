# Barebones Android Activity Template
Simplistic Android App Template for Android Studio

Contains the bare minimum to get an app up and running on Java 17 with view binding and a single activity.

This is an alternative to the empty project template that Android Studio provides, however, this
comes with most of the boilerplate already set up to get you started on mobile app development.

## To Use
1. Hit the green "Use this template" button at the top of the page and create a new repo
2. Either:
   1. Clone your new repo
   2. Open the project in Android Studio
   - Or
   1. Goto File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> Git and paste the URL of your new repo
3. Change the package name in the gradle.properties file
4. Change the package name in your Project Structure
5. Change the project name in the settings.gradle file
6. Delete this README.md file and replace it with your own
